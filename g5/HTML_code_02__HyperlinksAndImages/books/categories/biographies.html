        <blockquote>
            <p>'I am 94. I've had an extraordinary life. It's only now that I appreciate how extraordinary.</p>
            <p>
                As a young man, I felt I was out there in the wild, experiencing the untouched natural world - but it was an illusion. 
                The tragedy of our time has been happening all around us, barely noticeable from day to day - the loss of our planet's 
                wild places, its biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been witness to this decline. A Life on Our Planet is my witness statement, and my vision for the future. 
                It is the story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake - and how, if we act now, we can yet put it right.
            </p>
            <p>We have one final chance to create the perfect home for ourselves and restore the wonderful world we inherited.'</p>

        <p>All we need is the will to do so.</p>
